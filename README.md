I collaborated on this assignment with Sahil, with assistance from p5.js and p5.sound reference pages.

This program is of a face that blinks after a certain amoung of frames, with a gif as a background, as well as when the screen is pressed his face zooms in and the p5.sound library plays an eating sound.
